### Note:
The developers can also contribute in this project by creating a Machine Learning model, those who want to contribe a machine learning model has to follow the same rule but the are also required to show their sample of images generated by their model on atleast one image.

#### Also the ML model can only be contributed after the model is converted into ".tflite" file. No other format will be accepted. So, Developers need to keep this in mind that if the want to contribute a ml model they are required to convert it into a ".tflite" file.
